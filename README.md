Description: This is a game created for project 1 in ITCS-4230/5230. It is a vertical platforming game with core game mechanics revolving around climbing different types of ladders while scaling a tower. You will encounter enemies and obstacles along the way while also saving kittens that are trapped within the tower.

Story: You play as a brave and caring knight who has come to rescue their cat that has become a prisoner atop an evil cat wizard's tower. Within the tower, the cat's 20 kittens are also trapped in magical bubbles. It is the knight's duty to climb to the top of the tower and save their cat and her several kittens. The wizard will attempt to stop the knight by casting spells at them. The knight must beware of the wizard and their ghostly minions that patrol the tower.
